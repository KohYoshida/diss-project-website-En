        <h2>Special tax measures, known as "Sotoku," favor specific businesses or individuals' taxes and are referred to as "hidden subsidies." In the <a href="article1.html">first installment</a>, it was revealed that some of these special tax measures have been left in place despite having accomplished their purposes, or have avoided abolition for over 70 years by changing their objectives.<br><br>Here comes the next question. Is the government's oversight function working? In the second installment, we will report on special tax measures that seem to be continually extended by a "face pass" without proper examination.</h2>

        <h1 id="subheading1">Do you really think that it is related to economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic?</h1>

        <p class="texts">"The easing of the effects of the coronavirus infection, and the improvement in the financial situation of Living Environment Industry Association, will promote the development of shared facilities through this tax measure."</p>

        <p class="texts">This is an excerpt from the "Preliminary Evaluation Document" made last year by the Living Environment Division of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. It explains the expected future demand as a reason to extend the special depreciation related to "shared facilities."</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">・Living Environment Industry Association<br>An organization formed by people working in 18 industries closely related to daily life, such as dining, barbering, cleaning, and hotels. By establishing shared factory, hall etc., they can receive preferential corporate tax treatment. The aim is to support the many small and micro-businesses in competition with major chains, so they do not decline.<br>・Preliminary Evaluation Document<br>A document created by the competent authorities when requesting the establishment, expansion, or extension of Sotoku related to corporate tax. It describes purposes, achievements, goals, and explains the necessity and effectiveness.<br>・Review by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications<br>Some parts of the Preliminary Evaluation Document are checked annually by the Policy Evaluation Division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The main inspection item is whether there are any deficiencies in the explanation for "effectiveness."</p>
        </div>

        <p class="texts">In fact, from fiscal 2010, this tax measure was applied only once in fiscal 2011, and no one has used it since. Will the situation change if the economy recovers from the coronavirus crisis? When an explanation was sought from the Living Environment Division, an unconvincing response was returned, saying "●●."</p>

        <h1 id="subheading2">Repeatedly pointed out as "insufficiently explained," yet unimproved</h1>

        <p class="texts">The content of the project evaluation document has been checked annually by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications since 2010. The aim is to clarify the reasons for favoring specific groups, ignoring tax fairness, and to enhance the transparency of special tax measures. Since 2014, summaries of inspection results have been compiling the inadequately explained preliminary evaluation documents and the reasons for them.</p>

        <p class="inserted-image">※Top image = Summary of inspection results</p>

        <p class="texts">By tallying the measures that have been pointed out as problematic in the past, a total of 116 types were identified. Among them, the following five measures were particularly frequent, including the "special depreciation related to jointly used facilities" mentioned at the beginning.</p>

        <p class="quotes">
            Pointed out six times in the past: 2 cases<br>
            ・Special depreciation or investment tax deduction in National Strategic Special Zones<br>
            ・Income deduction system in National Strategic Special Zones<br><br>
            Pointed out five times: 2 cases<br>
            ・Tax measures to promote the strengthening of corporate bases in local areas<br>
            ・Special depreciation system for jointly used facilities established by Living Hygiene Trade Unions<br>
            ・Tax exemptions in tourist areas to promote Okinawa's tourism formation<br>
        </p>
        <p class="inserted-image">※If multiple problems were pointed out in the same year, it was counted as two times</p>

        <p class="texts">If the special tax measures were abolished, or the content of the preliminary evaluation document was improved, the number would not increase. In other words, the ones listed here are special tax measures that have been allowed to extend without solving the problems. The below charts illustrates the reasons that have been pointed out from 2014 to 2022.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-table" data-src="visualisation/14731312"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p class="texts">What stands out are the red circles indicating the claim that "the number of applications is very few." The squares representing the claim that "expectations and reality are far apart" are also calling for an explanation for why the measures were not utilized as anticipated.</p>

        <p class="texts">The diamond mark indicating "the effect of the special tax measure is unclear" points out that the direct impact of the special tax measure is not apparent. Companies use various support systems, making it challenging to judge whether the results explained in the preliminary evaluation document are due to the special tax measure. The triangular mark of "the goal is not appropriately set" is problematic because it becomes impossible to verify later whether the effect was achieved. The star mark states that it is unclear why support needs to be provided through taxes instead of subsidies or other means.</p>

        <p class="texts">While the diamond, triangle, and star marks have only been warned once, it can be seen that the circles and squares pointing out the small number of actual applications have been repeatedly pointed out.</p>

        <p class="texts">Is the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications' check functioning? The Policy Evaluation Division says that whether to extend the special measures is a job for the tax authorities, and they themselves simply want to "continue to improve the quality of evaluations through inspections." The Ministry of Finance explained the reason for extending the "special depreciation for jointly used facilities" as "●●."</p>

        <h1 id="subheading3">Considering the reasons why some measures are guaranteed to be extended</h1>

        <p class="texts">A problem often pointed out in the preliminary evaluation documents of Sotoku has another commonality; another law often mandates that preferential measures must be taken by Sotoku.</p>

        <p class="texts">For instance, the National Strategic Special Zone Law expressly states that there "shall be tax exemptions" for specific business operators regarding facility investments and income. According to inspection results, from 2015 to 2019, the special depreciation was applied only in two cases in the National Strategic Special Zones, with special deductions in seven cases, and income deductions only in one case between 2016 and 2019.</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">・National Strategic Special Zones<br>A system aimed at enhancing industrial competitiveness by easing regulations such as laws within specific areas, making it easier for companies to undertake research and development. It is led by the government. For example, automobile manufacturers can actually run self-driving cars on public roads within the special zone to collect driving data.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="texts">If it has already been decided that Sotoku will be implemented as part of the national strategy, the hurdle to abolish it is likely even higher. The decision cannot be made solely by the Ministry of Finance or some politicians, as reviewing Sotoku may affect the modification of the project, and careful coordination will be required over time.</p>

        <p class="texts">The number of applications is small. The justification for extension are insufficient. But it is difficult to abolish them. In this case, the problem does not lie solely with the tax authorities; the laxity in policy planning should also be pointed out. Rather than merely continuing to request extensions, there is a call for an attitude that examines the performance of Sotoku and strives to modify it into a more user-friendly system to lead the project to success.</p>
