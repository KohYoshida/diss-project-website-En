        <h2>Special tax measures, known as "Sotoku," favour certain businesses or individuals and are also called "hidden subsidies." In the <a href="article1.html">first instalment</a>, it was revealed that some of these measures have been left in place despite having accomplished their purposes, or have avoided abolition for over 70 years by changing their purposes.<br><br>This raises another question. Is the government's self-review scheme working properly? In the second instalment, I will report on special tax measures that appear to be extended continually without close investigation.</h2>

        <h1 id="subheading1">Is it truly related to economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic?</h1>

        <p class="texts">"The easing of the effects of the coronavirus infection, and the improvement in the financial situation of living environment industry associations, will promote the development of shared facilities through this tax measure."</p>

        <p class="texts">This is an excerpt from the "Preliminary Evaluation Document" made last year by the Living Environment Division of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. It explains the expected future demand as a reason to extend the Sotoku called "special depreciation for shared facilities established by living environment industry associations."</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">・Living Environment Industry Association<br>An organisation formed by people working in 18 industries closely related to daily life, such as dining, barbering, laundry services, and hotels.

        <p class="texts">In fact, this measure was only applied once in fiscal year 2011, and no one has used it since then. Will the situation change as the economy recovers from the coronavirus crisis? When questioned, the Living Environment Division explained that "Based on a survey of the associations, it was found that the measure is expected to be utilised when the economy recovers from the coronavirus crisis." However, this only amounts to one application this fiscal year, and another expected next year. When asked about the reason for the limited utilisation, they responded, "We would like to thoroughly publicise the benefits and the mechanism."</p>

        <h1 id="subheading2">Repeatedly flagged as "insufficiently explained" but still unaddressed</h1>

        <p class="texts">The content of some preliminary evaluation documents has been checked annually by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications since 2010. The aim is to clarify the reasons for favouring specific groups, ignoring tax fairness, and to enhance the transparency of special tax measures. Since 2014, summaries of these reviews have compiled documents with inadequate explanations and highlighted the reasons for their shortcomings.</p>

        <p class="inserted-image">※Top image = Summary of the Review</p>

        <p class="texts">By collecting the measures that have been pointed out as problematic in the past, a total of 116 types were identified. Among them, the following five measures were named particularly frequently, including the "special depreciation for shared facilities established by living environment industry associations" mentioned at the beginning.</p>

        <p class="quotes">
            Pointed out six times in the past: 2 cases<br>
            ・Special depreciation or investment tax deduction in national strategic special zones<br>
            ・Income deduction in national strategic special zones<br><br>
            Pointed out five times: 2 cases<br>
            ・Tax measures to promote the strengthening of corporate bases in local areas<br>
            ・Special depreciation for shared facilities established by living environment industry associations<br>
            ・Tax exemptions in tourist areas to promote Okinawa's tourism formation<br>
        </p>
        <p class="inserted-image">※If multiple problems were pointed out in the same year, it was counted as two times</p>

        <p class="texts">If the special tax measures were abolished, or the quality of the preliminary evaluation document was improved, the number would not increase. In other words, the ones listed here are special tax measures that have been allowed to extend without solving the problems. The chart below illustrates the reasons that have been pointed out from 2014 to 2022.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-table" data-src="visualisation/14731312"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p class="texts">What stands out are the red circles indicating the claim that "the number of applications is very few." The squares representing the claim that "expectations and reality are far apart" are also calling for an explanation for why the measures were not utilised as anticipated.</p>

        <p class="texts">The diamond mark indicating "the effects of Sotoku are unclear" points out that the direct impact of the special tax measure is not apparent. Companies use various support systems, making it challenging to judge whether the results explained in the preliminary evaluation document are due to the special tax measure. The triangular mark of "the goals are not set appropriately" is problematic because it becomes impossible to verify later whether the effect was achieved. The star mark states that it is unclear why support needs to be provided through taxes instead of subsidies or other methods.</p>

        <p class="texts">While the diamond, triangle, and star marks have only been warned once, it can be seen that the circles and squares pointing out the small number of actual applications have been repeatedly pointed out.</p>

        <p class="texts">Is the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications' review working properly? The Policy Evaluation Division says that whether to extend Sotoku is a job for the tax authorities, and they themselves simply try to "continue to improve the quality of evaluations through inspections."</p>

        <p class="texts"> How does the Ministry of Finance perceive the necessity of extending the "Special depreciation for shared facilities established by living environment industry associations"? When questioned about their stance, they responded, "the extension was decided upon after discussions during the tax reform process. Please inquire with the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, the responsible agency, regarding the need for its continuation."</p>

        <h1 id="subheading3">Understanding why some measures are guaranteed extensions</h1>

        <p class="texts">The special tax measures that have been pointed out for problems many times in the preliminary evaluation documents have another commonality; they are mandated by another law that requires the implementation of preferential measures through Sotoku.</p>

        <p class="texts">For instance, the national strategic special zone law states that there "shall be tax exemptions" for specific business operators regarding facility investments and income. According to the review, from 2015 to 2019, the special depreciation was applied only in two cases in the national strategic special zones, with special deductions in seven cases, and income deductions only in one case between 2016 and 2019.</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">・National Strategic Special Zones<br>A system aimed at enhancing industrial competitiveness by easing regulations such as laws within specific areas, making it easier for companies to undertake research and development. It is led by the government. For example, automobile manufacturers can run self-driving cars on public roads within the special zone to collect driving data.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="texts">If it has already been decided that Sotoku will be implemented as part of the national strategy, the hurdle to abolish it is likely even higher. The decision cannot be made solely by the Ministry of Finance or some politicians, as reviewing Sotoku may affect the modification of the entire project. Thorough preparations will be required in advance for building consensus of key persons of the project if someone wants to revise these measures.</p>

        <p class="texts">The number of applications is small. The justifications for extension are insufficient. But it is difficult to abolish them. In this case, the problem does not lie solely with the tax authorities; lax policy planning should also be pointed out. Rather than simply continuing to request extensions, policy makers should adopt a proactive approach, examining the performance of Sotoku and modifying it into a more user-friendly system to ensure project success.</p>
