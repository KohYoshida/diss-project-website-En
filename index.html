                I am Kou Yoshida, a postgraduate student at Cardiff University, pursuing the master's programme in "Computational and Data Journalism." Before joining the course, I worked as a journalist at the Yomiuri Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper company.<br><br>

This is my dissertation project. The theme is the Japanese Special Tax Measures, also known as "Sotoku". This system is designed to provide tax relief for select entities to promote policy objectives, such as industrial advancement.<br><br>

It is argued that the measures tend to persist as a vested interest, even if they have already achieved their intended purpose. However, the government's disclosure about Sotoku is not sufficiently transparent.<br><br>

In this project, I gathered open-source data about the Special Tax Measures and attempted to analyse their potential issues based on my journalistic experiences.
