        <h2>In parts <a href="article1.html">One</a> and <a href="article2.html">Two</a>, we delved into the current state of efforts to reorganise special tax measures, known as "Sotoku", as well as the effectiveness of the government's self-review scheme. While many insights were drawn from open data analysis, certain issues remain that cannot be quantified.<br><br>In this final instalment, I aim to shed light on the process behind the creation of Sotoku. Progress in reorganisation becomes moot if new Sotoku continues to emerge within the existing framework.</h2>

        <h1 id="subheading1">The fervour of appeals filling the Liberal Democratic Party Headquarters: What is the Tax Commission, an annual winter event?</h1>

        <p class="texts">Upon exiting the elevator, the area was enveloped in an unusual tension. Voices urging tax cuts rained down on the representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party as they hurriedly made their way to the conference room.</p>

        <p class="texts">"Please! Our Industry should be promoted by tax!"</p>

        <p class="texts">At the Liberal Democratic Party headquarters in Nagatacho, Tokyo, a corridor of merely about 10 metres connecting the elevator and the conference room was crowded with people in suits holding placards. Whether it was merely a gesture of familiarity or an indication of "leave it to me," some representatives met their eyes and gave a slight nod.</p>

        <p class="inserted-image">※Top image=appeal of industrial association</p>

        <p class="texts">They are primarily staff members responsible for external affairs with the government and the ruling party within industry associations. Ahead of the Liberal Democratic Party's tax commission, they directly appeal their demands to the participants. It's a hallmark of December as discussions on tax reform reach their climax.</p>

        <p class="texts">The tax commission is held in private. However, even when the conference room is shut, their work doesn't end. Alongside reporters covering tax reform, they approach the doors and walls, straining to overhear the discussions inside. The headquarters building, completed in 1966, has thin walls and many doors with gaps.</p>

        <p class="texts">Who will speak in favour of their industry? If the atmosphere suggests that extending the special tax provision is challenging, where lies the breakthrough? They search desperately for answers.</p>

        <p class="texts">"Representatives can only speak for once in the Commission. We visit those who support us during this precious opportunity to appeal our points individually." An insider involved in tax reform revealed.</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">・Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission<br>Meeting to decide tax reform contents. Concentrated annually from November to December. There are "general meetings" that any LDP member can join, "sub-commissions" with certain officials, and an "inner" informal meeting where a very few executives gather, considered the real decision-making place.<br>・Party tickets<br>Tickets to parties hosted by politicians for fundraising. The more purchased, the more support for political activities.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="texts">Participants are aware that their comments are being heard by industry associations. Support from these associations not only leads to consolidated votes during elections but is also believed to influence the sales of party tickets. Vocalising demands is not the only tactic in the negotiations surrounding tax reforms.</p>

        <h1 id="subheading2">Japan's unique tax reform process where the ruling party decides on government proposals</h1>

        <p class="quotes">"While the Ministry of Finance drafts the bill for tax reform to be submitted to the Diet, the contents are effectively determined by the ruling party. It's a structure that doesn't exist elsewhere in the world, where no one knows who takes responsibility"</p>

        <p class="texts"> Professor <a href="https://www.meiji.ac.jp/mugs2/faculty/tanaka-hideaki.html" target="_blank">Hideaki Tanaka</a>, a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat and expert on national finance and governance at Meiji University, points out.</p>

        <p class="texts">There are two tax Commissions in Japan: the "Government Tax Commission," composed mainly of experts who discuss structural tax issues from a medium to long-term perspective, and the Liberal Democratic Party's own tax Commission that determines annual tax reforms. As the LDP's tax Commission has gained influence, the other has shifted to discussing broader tax perspectives to avoid friction.</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">・Two similar tax reform outlines<br>The joint-ruling LDP and Komeito parties' tax Commissions compile the results of their discussions into the "Ruling Party Tax Reform Outlines" every December. The government then uses this as a basis to create the "Tax Reform Outlines" bill, which is enacted following Diet deliberations. Media attention consequently focuses on the content of the ruling party's outlines.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="texts">Tax reform is an intricate process entwined with political dynamics and vested interests. Involved parties work to skillfully negotiate the best compromises. The more delicate the issue, the less room there is for academic idealism.</p>


        <p class="texts">A well-known anecdote in Nagata-cho, where the LDP and the Diet locate, tells of LDP tax commission chairman Sadanori Yamanaka, known as the "Boss of Tax Commission," who in 1986 declared he was not "underestimating" but "ignoring" the government tax commission when questioned by reporters.</p>

        <p class="texts">According to the Asahi Shimbun, Prime Minister Kishida cautioned in July, "Individual tax matters are decided by the LDP," in response to a report from the government tax commission that questioned the validity of non-taxable commuting allowances for company employees. The Prime Minister himself quelled what was widely referred to by people as the "salaryman tax increase," fearing a drop in approval ratings.</p>

        <p class="texts">However, a shadow has been cast over the power of the LDP's tax commission. Once referred to as a "sanctuary," it was a stronghold controlled by influential members of LDP and lawmakers well-versed in tax legislation, who valued fiscal discipline. Now, they must also pay attention to the "prime minister's office." In 2015, Takeshi Noda, then-chairman of the LDP's tax commission, clashed with the Komeito Party, a coalition partner of the LDP, over the debate to raise the consumption tax rate. The LDP replaced Noda, and major media reported it as a "de facto dismissal." It is no longer rare for the direction decided by the LDP's tax commission to be overturned by the prime minister's office.</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">・Prime minister's office<br>It houses the Chief Cabinet Secretary and senior government officials and is where crucial national decisions are made. The phrase "the intention of the prime minister's office" carries a nuance of an "irreversible decision, whether one likes it or not." Its influence reportedly grew under the Abe administration.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="texts">The maintenance of political power, re-election in the polls, the ideal form of tax policy—what gets postponed? The answer seems clear to anyone.</p>

        <h1 id="subheading3">The flag of Sotoku reorganisation, raised by the Short-lived Democratic Party administration, was lowered</h1>

        <p class="texts">The reorganisation of Sotoku was prominently addressed in tax reforms under the Democratic Party's administration during the fiscal 2010 revision. The tax reform outlines asserted that, "For Sotoku to be justified, the actual application and effects must be transparent, understandable, and acceptable," prompting a thorough review over the subsequent four years. However, the Democratic Party's handling of the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and issues surrounding the relocation of the U.S. military base in Okinawa weakened its credibility, leading to its fall from power in 2012, which had implications for the momentum of Sotoku reforms.</p>

        <p class="texts">The review of the preliminary evaluation document by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, which was discussed in the <a href="article2.html">second part</a> of this series, also started in 2010 under the Democratic Party's administration. In that year, 219 checks were performed. However, since the party lost power, there has been a decreasing trend, and the number dropped to 43 last year, which is roughly a quarter of the checks performed in 2010.</p>

            <p class="texts">The aforementioned insider said, "Many of the tax reductions due to Sotoku are not that significant. The Liberal Democratic Party might be more concerned about how to increase tax revenue than the trends of Sotoku."</p> 

        <p class="texts">Every year, the same sentence is included in the ruling party's tax reform outline as if it's a ritualistic phrase stamped in place: "Every fiscal year, with a focus on those measures whose deadlines are approaching, we will review them from a zero-base, including their potential abolition, while thoroughly assessing their necessity and effects based on their application status." On the other hand, there have been no reports heard about this issue being discussed in the tax commission.</p>

        <p class="texts">As highlighted throughout this series, efforts to review Sotoku have remained stagnant, with no significant progress for 50 years. It's become evident that certain Sotoku measures lack sufficient justification. Relying on politicians, who are always swayed by the political situation, to take action does not seem wise.</p>

        <p class="texts">Instead of continuously advocating for nice-sounding principles, couldn' a rule be established, such as specifically stating goals and achievement levels, like in the preliminary evaluation document? For example, the outline could list the number of Sotoku 10 years from now, and the number of Sotoku that were reduced in the last year. As it stands, there's no way to gauge when Sotoku will become something "taxpayers can accept."</p>
