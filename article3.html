        <h2>In parts <a href="article1.html">One</a> and <a href="article2.html">Two</a>, we examined the current status of efforts to reorganize special tax measures (known as "Sotoku"), as well as the government's monitoring system. These were revealed through the analysis of open data, but there are also issues that cannot be quantified.<br><br>In the final installment, we want to clarify the process by which Sotoku is generated, through interviews with the people involved. Even if the reorganization progresses, it is meaningless if new Sotoku continues to be wantonly created under the existing mechanism.</h2>

        <p class="texts">"Please! Our Industry should be promoted by tax!"</p>

        <p class="texts">At the Liberal Democratic Party headquarters in Tokyo, the elevator halls are filled with industry association employees holding placards, shouting to call for a tax system favorable to their industries. This scene is a snapshot just before the start of the Liberal Democratic Party's Tax Commission meeting.</p>

        <p class="inserted-image">※Top image=appeal of industrial association</p>

        <p class="texts">Once the Commission begins, the floor suddenly falls silent. The headquarters building, completed in 1966, has thin walls and many doors with gaps. Who will speak in favor of their industry? If extending the Sotoku seems to be difficult, where is the breakthrough? They approach doors and walls to check the leaking debates carefully.</p>

        <p class="texts">"Representatives can only speak once in the Commission. We visit those who support us during this precious opportunity to request and consult. It also affects the number of party tickets we purchase," revealed an industry group insider involved in tax reform. It is presumably their true feelings that they expect "proper" work from those they are supporting, paying no small amount of money.</p>

        <p class="texts">Even for members of parliament, relationships with industry groups that lead to substantial votes during elections are essential. Gradually, the discussion on tax reform becomes distorted by influential industries and groups who have strong connections with key political figures.</p>

        <h1 id="subheading2">Japan's unique tax reform process where the ruling parties decides on government proposals.</h1>

        <p class="texts">"While the Ministry of Finance drafts the bill for tax reform to be submitted to the Diet, the contents are effectively determined by the ruling party. It's a structure that doesn't exist elsewhere in the world, where no one knows who takes responsibility"</p>

        <p class="texts"> Professor <a href="https://www.meiji.ac.jp/mugs2/faculty/tanaka-hideaki.html" target="_blank">Hideaki Tanaka</a>, a former Finance Ministry bureaucrat and expert on national finance and governance at Meiji University, points out.</p>

        <p class="texts">There are two tax Commissions in Japan: the "Government Tax Commission," composed mainly of experts who discuss structural tax issues from a medium to long-term perspective, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's own tax Commission that determines annual tax reforms. As the LDP's tax Commission has gained influence, the other has shifted to discussing broader tax perspectives to avoid friction.</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">・Two similar tax Commissions<br>There are two tax Commissions in Japan: the "Government Tax Commission," composed mainly of experts who discuss structural tax issues from a medium to long-term perspective, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's own tax Commission that determines annual tax reforms. As the LDP's tax Commission has gained influence, the other has shifted to discussing broader tax perspectives to avoid friction.<br>・Two similar tax reform outline<br>The LDP and Komeito parties' tax Commissions compile the results of their discussions into the "Ruling Party Tax Reform Guidelines" every December. The government then uses this as a basis to create the "Tax Reform Guidelines" bill, which is enacted following Diet deliberations. Media attention consequently focuses on the content of the ruling party's guidelines.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="texts">Tax reform is an intricate process entwined with political dynamics and vested interests. Parties involved prioritize finding a skillful compromise. The more delicate the issue, the less room there is for academic idealism.</p>


        <p class="texts">A well-known anecdote in Nagata-cho, where the LDP and the Diet locate, tells of LDP tax commission chairman Sadanori Yamanaka, known as the "The Boss of Tax Commission," who in 1986 declared he was not "underestimating" but "ignoring" the government tax Commission when questioned by reporters.</p>

        <p class="texts">According to the Asahi Shimbun, Prime Minister Kishida cautioned in July, "Individual tax matters are decided by the LDP," in response to a report from the government tax commission that questioned the validity of non-taxable commuting allowances for company employees. The Prime Minister himself quelled what became known as the "salaryman tax increase," fearing a drop in approval ratings.</p>

        <p class="texts">On the other hand, a shadow can be seen over the power of the LDP's Tax Committee. Once referred to as a "sanctuary," it was a stronghold controlled by influential members of LDP and lawmakers well-versed in tax legislation, who valued fiscal discipline. Now, they must also pay attention to the "prime minister's office." In 2015, Takeshi Noda, then-chairman of the LDP's Tax Commission, clashed with the Komeito Party, a coalition partner, over the debate to raise the consumption tax rate. The LDP replaced Noda, and major media reported it as a "de facto dismissal." It is no longer rare for the direction decided by the LDP's Tax Commission to be overturned by the prime minister's office.</p>

            <p class="memo-body">・Prime minister's office<br>It houses the Chief Cabinet Secretary and senior government officials and is where crucial national decisions are made. The phrase "Prime minister's office's intention" carries a nuance of an "irreversible decision, whether one likes it or not." Its influence is said to have increased under the Abe administration.</p>

        <p class="texts">The maintenance of political power, re-election in the polls, the ideal form of tax policy—what gets postponed? The answer seems clear to anyone.</p>

        <h1 id="subheading3">The flag of Sotoku review, once raised by Short-lived Democratic Party administration ,was lowered</h1>

        <p class="texts">The last time that the revision of special tax measures (hereafter referred to as "Sotoku") became a major theme in recent tax reforms was under the Democratic Party's administration, during the fiscal 2010 revision. The tax reform outline stated, "For Sotoku to be justified, the actual application and effects must be transparent and understandable, and something taxpayers can accept," and declared a radical review over the subsequent four years. However, the Democratic Party lost credibility due to its confusion in responding to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and the issue surrounding the relocation of the U.S. military base in Okinawa, ultimately falling from power in 2012.</p>

        <p class="texts">The inspection of the preliminary evaluation report by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, which was discussed in the <a href="article2.html">second part</a>, also started in 2010 under the Democratic Party's administration. There were 219 checks performed that year, but last year the number fell to 43, a quarter of the previous amount.<br>
            An industry group insider said, "The Liberal Democratic Party may not have the same awareness of Sotoku issues as the Democratic Party's administration. They are thinking about how to increase tax revenue, but many of the revenue reductions due to Sotoku are not that significant, so they probably don't pay much attention to each trend."</p>

        <p class="texts">The ruling party's tax reform outline annually contains the same sentence, as if stamped with a rubber stamp: "Every fiscal year, focusing mainly on those whose deadline has arrived, each measure's usage, etc., will be carefully assessed, and a zero-based review, including abolition, will be carried out." On the other hand, there have been no reports heard of this issue being discussed in tax debates.</p>

        <p class="texts">As seen in this series, the review of Sotoku has been stalled at the same stage for 50 years. It has also become clear that there are Sotoku that can be reviewed. Relying on politicians, who are swayed by the political situation, to take action does not seem wise.</p>

        <p class="texts">Instead of continuously advocating for nice-sounding principles, can't a rule be created, such as specifically stating goals and achievement levels, like in the preliminary evaluation report? For example, the outline could list the number of Sotoku 10 years from now, and the number of Sotoku that were reduced in the last year. As it stands, there's no way to gauge when Sotoku will become something "taxpayers can accept."</p>
