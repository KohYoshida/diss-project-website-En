        <h2>Ignoring the three principles of "fairness, neutrality, and simplicity," there exists a system known as "Special Tax Measures" (commonly referred to as "Sotoku"), which gives preferential treatment to the taxes of a limited number of people. Though intended as a special case, it quickly became an entrenched vested interest, encountering fierce resistance from stakeholders and thus becoming difficult to abolish. The government has long been struggling to organize and reduce this system.<br><br>With the nation's debt exceeding 1,000 trillion yen, there is no room to wastefully favor tax money. Are there elements within these special tax measures that are not worthy of being called "special"? Is the government's approach effective? An investigation based on open data was conducted. The first installment introduces the "elders" who have survived since the post-war era.</h2>

        <h1 id="subheading1">Comprehensive data on "Sotoku" is not publicly available, making it difficult to grasp the whole picture</h1>

        <p class="texts">No comprehensive data, such as a list related to the Special Tax Measures ("Sotoku"), the status of their application, or the background of their establishment, has been publicly released. For this investigation, a dataset was created by compiling materials previously investigated by the Board of Audit. These materials, referred to as "occasional reports," include the results of investigations into corporate tax-related Sotoku in 2015, income tax-related in 2016, and inheritance tax-related in 2017.</p>
        <p class="texts">As a result, a list was compiled containing details of 241 measures, including their names, start dates, and applicable clauses. Each measure was then individually compared with the current text of the Special Tax Measures Law (as of May 1, 2023), and those that had already been abolished or whose continuation was doubtful were excluded. Further narrowing down to only those measures that had been in place for over 10 years, 182 remained on the list. This covers approximately half of the total data.</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">The Special Tax Measures ("Sotoku") are an exceptional system that allows deviations from the three principles of taxation: "fairness, neutrality, and simplicity." Through this, the government can favor taxes for specific industries or individuals for policy purposes such as industrial support. It is also referred to as "hidden subsidies."<br>According to the Asahi Shimbun, as of January 2022, there were 367 such measures. The reduction in tax revenue for the fiscal year 2020 alone exceeded at least 8 trillion yen, accounting for a scale equivalent to approximately one-tenth of the tax revenue for that year.</p>

        </div>

        <h1 id="subheading2">It has been revealed that there are at least 13 measures involving the "elders" over 70 years old</h1>

        <p class="texts">Analyzing this data reveals that the most common measures were those lasting between 10 and 20 years, numbering 49, while 13 measures had exceeded 70 years. Incidentally, the Special Tax Measures Law, with its precursor enacted in 1938, has continued to this day after a complete revision in 1957. The "Sotoku" that are over 66 years old would have existed even before the comprehensive overhaul.</p>

        <h1 id="subheading3">Representative examples of the problems with "Sotoku": Either evolving to survive or merely being left unattended</h1>

        <p class="texts">The top two measures in the longevity ranking can be aptly described as illustrative examples of the problems with "Sotoku."</p>

        <p class="texts">The "Non-Taxation of Interest on Tax Payment Reserve Deposits" stipulates that interest is not taxed when savings are made for the purpose of tax payments. It was established shortly after World War II, in 1949. Documents from the National Tax Agency show that the number of demand letters sent the year before this measure was instituted was around 8 million. The newly incurred delinquencies amounted to roughly 40% of the total that should have been paid, leading to a situation described as a "critical state in tax revenue."</p>

        <p class="inserted-image">※Top Image = A flyer in which the government calls for tax payments.</p>

        <p class="texts">This rate had dropped to 1.7% in the fiscal year 2021, and currently, it continues to "remain at a low level." Despite achieving some success and despite changes in the social climate, the system remains in place as it is. If this mechanism is deemed necessary for the future, should it not be removed from the special measures and instead be defined under the income tax law?</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">・"Honsoku"<br>In contrast to special laws like the Special Tax Measures Law, income tax and corporate tax are referred to as the "Honsoku(=Main Rule)," which prescribes basic and fundamental systems that are common to taxpayers. While "Sotoku" include permanent measures that function like the main rule, the main rule also contains provisions that are similar in nature to Sotoku, contributing to the complexity and making Sotoku difficult to understand.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="texts">"The Special Depreciation of Ships" is also a product of the time when the reconstruction of maritime transport networks was an urgent priority for post-war recovery.</p>
        
        <p class="texts">Originally, the measure favored corporate tax at the time of acquiring "ships." Eventually, the subject changed to those "equipped with modern facilities," and currently, it is applied to vessels that reduce environmental impact.<br>Now, the burden of investment in environmental measures is not limited to the maritime industry alone. There is no satisfactory explanation to be found as to why it is still acceptable for the government to support this, without enabling the industry to stand on its own.</p>

        <h1 id="subheading4">The "first stage" of re-evaluating "Sotoku," which has been at a standstill for over 50 years</h1>

        <p class="texts">Discussions on revising "Sotoku" by the government have been around since at least the 1950s. The specific policy has not changed since it was indicated in the governmen's tax inquiry report of 1975. Here's a summary:</p>

        <p class="quotes">
            ・Measures that deviate from the fairness or neutrality of taxation for a certain purpose are referred to as "policy taxation.<br>
            ・Besides these, special tax measures include things that should be stipulated in the main rules, and those that should eventually be absorbed into the main rules.<br>
            ・The review of special tax measures will first address policy taxation. The "others" will continue to be considered.
            </p>

        <p class="texts">Examples of policy taxation should be the "Special Depreciation of Ships," while "others" might include measures like "Non-taxation of Interest on Tax Reserve Deposits." The fact that neither has been resolved indicates that the government's efforts have been stalled in a state of "first addressing policy taxation..." for about 50 years.</p>
        
        <p class="texts">What is obstructing the abolition of policy taxation is the industries that have benefited from it. An industry association insider responded to an interview on the condition of anonymity.</p>

        <p class="texts">This association has, for many years, crafted negotiation strategies with related government agencies, wooed the Ministry of Finance and ruling party members, and worked on extending special tax measures. "Member companies that have used these special measures are planning their businesses on the assumption that they exist. Some people even forget that it's a special measure, mistakenly thinking it's an original system. There are people who rely on it, so if we can't extend it, it would cause serious trouble," explained the situation in the industrial world.</p>
