        <h2>Despite the foundational principles of "fairness, neutrality, and simplicity," a system "Special Tax Measures" (often referred to as "Sotoku" in Japanese) exists, providing preferential tax treatment to select people and companies. While initially envisioned as temporary solutions, these measures often evolve into vested interests, facing resistance from stakeholders and, as a result, proving difficult to abolish. The government has long been struggling to organize and simplify this system.<br><br>With the nation's debt exceeding 1,000 trillion yen, there is no leeway for wasteful tax privileges. Do some of these special tax measures no longer justify their existence? Is the government's approach for re-organizing the measures effective? An investigation based on open data was conducted. The first installment introduces the "elders" which have survived since the post-war era.</h2>

        <h1 id="subheading1">Comprehensive data on "Sotoku" is not publicly available, making it difficult to grasp the whole picture</h1>

        <p class="texts">No comprehensive data, such as a list of the Special Tax Measures, the status of their application, or the background of their establishment, has been publicly released. For this investigation, a dataset was created by compiling materials previously investigated by the Board of Audit of Japan. These materials, referred to as "occasional reports," include the results of investigations into corporate tax related Sotoku in 2015, income tax related Sotoku in 2016, and inheritance tax related Sotoku in 2017.</p>
        <p class="texts">As a result, a list was compiled containing details of 241 measures, including their names, start dates, and applicable clauses. Each measure was then individually compared with the current text of the Special Tax Measures Law (as of May 1, 2023), and those that had already been abolished or whose continuation was doubtful were excluded. Further narrowing down to only those measures that had been in place for over 10 years, 182 remained on the list. This covers approximately half of the total measures.</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">The Special Tax Measures are an exceptional method that allows the government to favor taxes for specific industries or individuals for policy purposes such as industrial support. It is also referred to as "hidden subsidies," since it works like the government gives money to support them.<br>According to the ministry of finance, there were 366 such measures as of May 2023. The reduction in tax revenue for the fiscal year 2021 alone was 6.7 trillion yen (equivalent to around 36 billion pounds assuming the currency exchange rate at 185yen to 1 pound), accounting for a scale equivalent to approximately one-tenth of the tax revenue for that year.</p>

        <h1 id="subheading2">It has been revealed that at least 13 measures that are over 70 years old</h1>

        <p class="texts">Analyzing this data reveals that the largest number of measures were those lasting between 10 and 20 years, numbering 49, while 13 measures had exceeded 70 years. Incidentally, the Special Tax Measures Law, with its precursor enacted in 1938, has continued to this day after a complete revision in 1957. The "Sotoku" that are over 66 years old would have existed even before the comprehensive overhaul.</p>

        <h1 id="subheading3">Representative examples of the problems with Sotoku: Evolving to survive or simply being neglected</h1>

        <p class="texts">The top two measures in the longevity ranking can be aptly described as illustrative examples of the problems with Sotoku.</p>

        <p class="texts">The "non-taxation for interest in tax payment deposits" refers to a policy where interest is not taxed when savings are specifically designated for tax payments. This measure was established shortly after World War II, in 1949. According to documents from the National Tax Agency, about 8 million reminder notices for payment were sent out in the year before this measure was introduced. The newly accumulated unpaid taxes constituted roughly 40% of the total amount due in the year, pushing Japan's tax revenue into "a critical state" at the time.</p>

        <p class="inserted-image">※Top Image = A flyer in which the government calls for tax payments.</p>

        <p class="texts">The rate dropped to 1.7% in fiscal year 2021, and currently, it "continues to remain at a low level." Even after successfully encouraging people to pay taxes and despite societal changes, the system has remained unchanged. If this mechanism is deemed necessary for the future, it should be removed from special measures and instead be incorporated into the income tax law.</p>

        <div class="memo">
            <p class="memo-title">Note:</p>
            <p class="memo-body">・"Honsoku"<br>In contrast to special laws like the Special Tax Measures Law, income tax and corporate tax are referred to as the "Honsoku (Main Rule)," which sets out the basic and fundamental systems applicable to all taxpayers. While "Sotoku" include permanent measures that operate similarly to the main rule, the Honsoku itself also contains provisions that work like Sotoku. This overlapping nature adds the complexity and makes Sotoku difficult to understand.</p>

        <p class="texts">The "special depreciation of ships" is also a product of the time when the reconstruction of maritime transport networks was an urgent priority for post-war recovery.</p>
        
        <p class="texts">Originally, the measure provided tax benefits for acquiring "ships." Over time, this evolved to favor those "equipped with modern facilities," and now, it applies to vessels that minimize environmental impact. However, the investment burden for environmentally-friendly facilities isn't exclusive to the maritime industry. It's unclear why the government continues to provide this support, rather than allowing the industry to become self-sufficient.</p>

        <h1 id="subheading4">The "first stage" of re-organizing "Sotoku," which has been at a standstill for over 50 years</h1>

        <p class="texts">Discussions on reviewing Sotoku have been around since at least the 1950s. The direction of the review in the government has not changed since it was outlined in the government's tax report of 1975. Here's a summary:</p>

        <p class="quotes">
            ・Measures that deviate from the fairness or neutrality of taxation for a certain purpose are referred to as "policy taxation."<br>
            ・Apart from these, special tax measures include things that should be stipulated in the main rules, and those that should eventually be merged into the main rules.<br>
            ・The review of special tax measures will first address the issue of policy taxation. The "others" will continue to be considered.
            </p>

        <p class="texts">Examples of policy taxation should be the "special depreciation of ships," while "others" might include measures like "non-taxation for interest in tax payment deposits." The fact that either measure still lives as Sotoku without a convincing justification indicates that the government's efforts have been in a stage of "first addressing policy taxation..." for about 50 years.</p>
        
        <p class="texts">Who wishes the extension of policy taxation is the industries that have benefited from it. An insider told me the situation where they are in on the condition of anonymity.</p>

        <p class="texts">This person has, for many years, worked on extending special tax measures, wooing the Ministry of Finance and parliament members with related government agencies.</p>

        <p class="quotes">"Companies that have utilized Sotoku have been building their business plans on the assumption of its existence. Since this special provision is indispensable for business operations, we will continue to request its extension."</p>
